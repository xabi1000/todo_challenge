# Todo App
Welcome to my Todo App project!

## Description
This project was developed as part of the "Todo app" challenge on DevChallenges.io. The task was to create a todo list application following the provided designs. I utilized my frontend development skills and experience with the Svelte framework to achieve the challenge objectives.

## Implemented Features
- **Add a New Task**: You can easily add new tasks to your list using the provided input field.
- **Complete a Task**: Mark tasks as completed with a simple click to track your progress.
- Toggle Between **All**, **Active**, and **Completed**: Use the filter buttons to view tasks based on their status :**all**, **active**, or **completed**.
- **Remove Tasks**: You have the option to remove individual tasks or all completed tasks under the "Completed" tab.
- **Local Storage**: I implemented browser storage to save your tasks even after refreshing the page.



## Customizations

In addition to meeting the challenge requirements, I added some customizations to enhance the user experience:

- **Smooth Transitions**: Implemented smooth transitions to improve interaction and aesthetics.
- **Custom Icons**: Used Tabler icons to enhance the visual appearance of the application.
- **Custom Styles**: Made color and style changes to add a personal touch to the application.
